## Color Palette

![color](UI/color.png)

We use a **calm and professional color palette** to ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. The colors are chosen to provide a clean and modern look while maintaining readability and accessibility.

### Color Palette:

- **#F9F7F7**: Very light gray (used for backgrounds and light mode).
- **#DBE2EF**: Light blue-gray (used for secondary elements and input fields).
- **#3F72AF**: Medium blue (used for primary buttons, accents, and highlights).
- **#112D4E**: Dark navy blue (used for text, dark mode backgrounds, and headers).

### Usage:

- **Backgrounds**: `#F9F7F7` for light mode, `#112D4E` for dark mode.
- **Text**: `#112D4E` for primary text, `#3F72AF` for accents.
- **Buttons**: `#3F72AF` for primary buttons, `#DBE2EF` for secondary buttons.
- **Borders/Dividers**: `#DBE2EF` for subtle borders and dividers.

You can view the color palette on [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/palette/f9f7f7dbe2ef3f72af112d4e).

## 🏗️ System Architecture & Design

### **📌 MVC Architecture for Scalability & Maintainability**

Our system follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern**, ensuring **modular, clean, and scalable development**.

| **Layer**      | **Responsibilities**                                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model**      | Business logic, database access (JDBC, DAO).                        |
| **View**       | JavaFX UI, dynamic updates using FXML.                              |
| **Controller** | Handles user interactions and updates the view based on model data. |

✅ **Separation of Concerns** – Clean division between UI, logic, and data  
✅ **Scalability** – Easily extendable with new features  
✅ **Testability** – Supports unit testing with mock implementations

---

### **📌 Singleton Pattern for Resource Management**

To optimize performance and **prevent redundant instances**, we use the **Singleton Pattern** for:

✅ **Database Access** – Ensuring a single connection instance  
✅ **RMI Server Instance** – Managing distributed connections efficiently  
✅ **Configuration Management** – Centralized settings handling

## 🚀 **Result:** Secure, thread-safe, and optimized database access.

## Database

The application uses a **secure and scalable database** to store:

- User profiles and credentials.
- Chat history and messages.
- File transfer logs.
- Server statistics and activity logs.

# Database Schema

This section provides an overview of the database schema for the **SUHBA Chat Application**. The schema is designed to support user management, messaging, group chats, contacts, and administrative functionalities.

## Schema Diagram

For a visual representation of the database schema, refer to the following diagram:

![Database Schema](databaseSchema/schema.png)

## SQL Script

The SQL script for creating the database schema can be found at:  
**Relative Path**: `mysql.sql`

[View SQL Script](databaseSchema/drawSQL-mysql-export-2025-02-15.sql)

### **📌 Database Optimization & Security**

✔ **Indexing on frequently searched fields** (`userId`, `phone`, `email`)  
✔ **Foreign Key Constraints** for **data integrity**  
✔ **Normalization (3NF)** to **eliminate redundancy**  
✔ **SQL Injection Protection** with **Prepared Statements**

🚀 **Result:** Secure, scalable, and efficient database management.
